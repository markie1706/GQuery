# GQuery Summary
This repository exists to share approaches to fast and efficient creation, reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) of spatial data. These approaches are based on an approach to spatial data that stores it based on a two part index, derived from polar coordinates. 

As of now the sole example of this approach is a simple radius query determining which stored points are within some distance of a given input point. Work is underway on other spatial query types and supporting more complex spatial data such as 2D and 3D shapes.

The simple radius query is a great example of the underlying novel approach to the storing and querying of spatial data which seems to be faster than existing approaches.
